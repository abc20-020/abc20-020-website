            <u>1. Tokyo Cherry Blossom Festivals</u>
        </h2>
    </strong>
    <p>The Cherry Blossom Festival ussualy takes place mid march and ends early april. The day will run well into the evening, with crafts for sale specific to the festival’s region, and food available all day. A particularly calming and special way to take in the festival is with a traditional Japanese tea ceremony held under the cherry blossom trees. At night, many festivals will be decorated with paper lanterns throughout the trees, maintaining the beauty of the flowers into the night. This is known as ‘yozakura’, which means ‘night sakura’.</p>
    <p>Second to the beautiful flowers in the festival is the food. Families will enjoy a nice picnic under the blossoming trees also sweet and savoury dishes are enjoyed at the festival, and are often themed to match the pink blossoms. Picnic baskets will be full of treats like tamagoyaki, a rolled egg omelette with sugar and soy sauce. Many traditional desserts will be found, made from anko (red bean paste) and mochi (a sweet and sticky rice cake). Sakura mochi is tinted pink to match the cherry blossoms.</p>

            <u>2. Fireworks Festivals</u>
        </h2>
    </strong>
   <p>Another popular festival in Tokyo is fireworks festivals. Unlike most countries, Japan doesn’t celebrate the New Year with fireworks but instead has its own fireworks festival during the summer.
    The fireworks festival, also known as the Hanabi festival, has a long history in Japan and is an important tradition during Summer. Both locals and tourists gather in parks and venues to see the beautiful and amazing fireworks, enjoy the food and games from stalls before the show, and enjoy the nice weather in the evening.
    As it can get very crowded easily, some of the shows sell tickets in advance for the best viewing spots, and for the one that does not sell the tickets, people usually show up a few hours before the show to reserve the best spots. In fact, not only is the venue getting crowded, but also the transportation and accommodation around the venues are full of people. Therefore, you may need to plan very well before attending the events. </p>

        Japanese Shrine festivals mostly include Mikoshi (portable shrine acting as palanquins to transport divine spirit) parades, food and snack vendors, game stalls, and cultural performances. The Mikoshi is paraded up and down on the streets by the people wearing traditional clothing and chanting to keep energy high.
        You can try various types of foods, and enjoy the games before or after the Mikoshi parade. Not all, but many shrine festivals include a special cultural performance such as dances, plays, athletic events such as sumo matches in the Nezu Shrine Autumn Festivals.

This is the most elaborate Japanese event where people clean their homes, pay their debts, and prepare Osechi (food in lacquered trays for the New Year).
        During the first 3 days of the New Year (1st-3rd January), people usually visit shrines and temples to pray and express their gratitude. This tradition is called “Hatsumode”. During this time, shrines and temples are filled with people and food vendors You can experience the New Year like locals through this tradition. Just keep in mind that it’s incredibly crowded!

            <strong>Shoping in Tokyo</strong>
        </h2>
        <p> Shopping in Tokyo is an important part of the crazed consumer culture – in fact, it can constitute an essential cultural experience for expats. For one, Tokyo has a bizarrely futuristic shopping environment with everything from underwear to watermelons available from vending machines.
        <br>The city is also at the cutting edge of fashion, design and electronics – most famously in Akihabara. Bargains are rare, so be prepared to pay for the privilege of shopping here.</p>
        <p>Shopping malls are a major part of the urban landscape. Shinjuku Station is surrounded by multi-level malls retailing every item imaginable. Major chains like Keio and Isetan can be reached directly from the station. Both have tax-free shopping and European language assistance. Check out Mitsukoshi department stores for a more upmarket shopping experience.</p>
        <p>Those looking for gifts for loved ones back home should look out for traditional items like Daruma dolls and crafts such as ceramics and chop-sticks. Kimonos are always good, although quality garments are expensive. Ideal locations to find souvenirs are the Oriental Bazaar and along Omotesando.</p>

            <h2>Eating out in Tokyo</h2>
            <p>The biggest city in the world by population, Tokyo might well be the globe’s cuisine capital as well. Restaurants in Tokyo are plentiful – the city has more Michelin stars to its name than any other, and boasts eateries offering all manner of ethnic cuisines, fine dining experiences, local delicacies and foreign foods. Of course, Japanese sushi is a must-have and whether one is in Tokyo to stay or just passing through, there are plenty of options to choose from.</p>

            <h2>Nightlife in Tokyo</h2>
            <p>The nightlife in Tokyo is excellent, offering everything from geisha bars to jazz clubs, escort clubs and crazily themed dance clubs. It certainly helps that it’s legal to drink in public and that vending machines stock cans of beer. The best party area is Roppongi, which has quite friendly locals very familiar with Westerners. Other key nightlife areas are Kabukicho, in Shinjuku, and Ginza.</p>
